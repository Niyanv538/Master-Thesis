The files contain three analyses for the Master's Thesis in Data science and society at Tilburg university. The aim of this project was to investigate how ADHD subtypes (ADHD-I, ADHD-H, ADHD-C) emerge using EEG data. The analysis used two datasets - supervised and unsupervised. 
The first part includes a file called "Data Preprocessing pipeline.m" which uses a manually created pipeline in MatLab to preprocess raw EEG signals from the unsupervised Bajestani et al. (2023) dataset. 
The file called "Brainhack dataset model.R" uses a multinomial logistic regression model on a small labeled dataset extracted from the Brainhack project in R studio. It aimes to predict the three ADHD subtypes using the F-score. The same file contains the EDA and subsetting of the other large preprocessed unsupervised dataset from Bajestani et al. (2023). 
The file called "Clustering analysis official.ipynb" uses clustering approaches via Hierarchical and Fuzzy c-means on both datasets in Jupyter Notebooks.
